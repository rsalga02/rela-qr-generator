- Download QR as PNG (auto file name based on the address)
- Fully offline (no external libraries)

## Quick Deploy Options

### Option A: GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload `index.html` to the repo.
3. In repo **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Source** to `main` (or default) and root folder. Save.
4. Wait ~30s, then open the site URL GitHub shows under **Pages**.

### Option B: Netlify (drag & drop)
1. Sign in at Netlify and go to the **Sites** page.
2. Drag-and-drop the entire unzipped folder onto the page to deploy.

- The `sms:` link format used is: `sms:+1XXXXXXXXXX&body=...` which iOS supports.
